            1944 ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And
            Computer, was the first large-scale, electronic, digital

            In 1952 woman named Grace Hopper wrote the first compiler.

            The was the first step in abstraction away from the 1's and
            0's and towards code that was easier for people to read.

          <p class="fragment">
            (Side note: Grace Hopper was also the person the coined the

						&ldquo;For me, the purpose of life is, at least partly, to
            have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can
            concentrate on the creative side of programming, so Ruby is
            designed to make programmers happy.&rdquo;

            As you can see our code is not much easier to digest.
            It almost has a naritive when you read it
            The next programmer that reads your code will likely thank you for
            your small methods. Maybe even give you a hug!
